I am a postdoctoral researcher at the mathematics and statistics department, McGill university, QC, Canada. [comment]: <> ( I am working with Assoc. Prof. Tim Hoheisel and Asst. Prof. Courtney Paquette.) 





My research is focused on continuous optimization with a particular interest in decomposition and first order methods for solving large scale, possibly nonconvex, problems.
